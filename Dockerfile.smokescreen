# Smokescreen egress proxy
# https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen
#
# Smokescreen is an HTTP CONNECT proxy that can filter outbound connections.
# It's used to intercept and control network traffic from sandbox containers.
#
# For Kubernetes/Helm deployments, the ACL config is mounted from a ConfigMap.
# For Docker Compose, the baked-in ACL file is used directly.
